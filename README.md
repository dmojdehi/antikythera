The app has been rewritten into Swift 3, using Xcode 8.  It's a test bed for working with OpenGL and Metal.

> Important: This project is available publicly for posterity and access for BC students learning iOS. It is the first iOS project I ever made (for iOS 3.2 on the original iPad when it debuted in 2010), so it is horribly written, outdated, and probably doesn't work anymore. Proceed at your own risk.

A 3D, real-time, interactive model of the Antikythera Mechanism. This project was created for the Spring 2010 iPhone Development course taught by Prof. Robert Muller at Boston College.
