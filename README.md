antikythera
===========

A 3D, real-time, interactive model of the Antikythera Mechanism.

This project was created for the Spring 2010 iPhone Development course taught by Prof. Robert Muller at Boston College. This was my first iOS project ever, so the code is in desparate need of care, and was also designed for iOS 3, which was the current OS release at the time. I open-sourced this project since I never got around to improving and releasing it myself. While the drawing code is far out-of-date, the research I put into how to reconstruct the device, embodied within the initialization code of the app, is likely still useful.
