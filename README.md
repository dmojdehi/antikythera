> Important: This project is available publicly for posterity and access for BC students learning iOS. It is the first iOS project I ever made (for iOS 3.2 on the original iPad when it debuted in 2010), so it is horribly written, outdated, and probably doesn't work anymore. Proceed at your own risk.
